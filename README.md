The interactive-fiction game engine we designed in class.

This is a interactive-fiction game designed from the core base game engine we designed in G320 game technology class at IU. The game entails a user waking up stranded on an isolated island. The user must explore different locations around the island in order to find a way off the island before the elements of the isalnd win and the user dies. This game was created using python.
