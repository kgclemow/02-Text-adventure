The interactive-fiction game engine we designed in class.

This is a interactive-fiction game designed from the core base game engine we designed in G320 game technology class at IU. The game entails a user waking up stranded on an isolated island. The user must explore different locations around the island and collect a few objects to win the game and collect all of the available points in order to find a way off the island. This game was created using python and helped teach the basics of using json files that are then implemented in to a main game frame.
